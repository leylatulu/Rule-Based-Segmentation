## Data Set Story
The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products.

The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means that the _table is not deduplicated_. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics **may have made more than one purchas**.
